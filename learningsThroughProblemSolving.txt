"a".charCodeAt(0);  -- finding ascii code
String.fromCharCode(ascii_code)  -- vice versa should work in this fashion
num = Math.floor(num / 10) --- for dividing by /10 an integer (like in java)


let items = new Map() --- map data structure in javaScript
map. set() .get() .has() .size .delete() .clear
for (let [number, activity] of activities) {  --- for iteration purposes
    console.log(`Activity ${number} is ${activity}`);
}


//so this is kinda string behaviour but it is what it is
type DayOfTheWeek = "sunday" | "monday" | "tuesday" | "wednesday" | "thursday" | "friday" | "saturday";
type DayOfTheWeekMap<T> = { [day in DayOfTheWeek]: T };
const chores: DayOfTheWeekMap<string> = {
    "sunday": "do the dishes",
    "monday": "walk the dog",
    "tuesday": "water the plants",
    "wednesday": "take out the trash",
    "thursday": "clean your room",
    "friday": "mow the lawn",
    "saturday": "relax",
};

//Some another stuff I didn't know about 
interface IRuleKey {
  [index: number]: number;
}
const temp: IRuleKey = {
  12: 0,
};
console.log(temp[12]);

//How to make 2d array work???
look at the question no 018.ts  -- pretty dope shit heheh
